=head1 NAME

Lingua::Stem::IO - Ido stemmer

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Lingua::Stem::Patch::IO v0.00_1.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Lingua::Stem::Patch::IO qw( stem_io );

    $stem = stem_io($word);

    # alternate syntax
    $stem = Lingua::Stem::Patch::IO::stem($word);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A stemmer for the universal language Ido. This is a new project under active
development and the current stemming algorithm is likely to change.

This module provides the C<stem> and C<stem_io> functions, which are synonymous
and can optionally be exported. They accept a single word and return a single
stem.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Lingua::Stem::Patch> provides a stemming object with access to all of the
Patch stemmers including this one. It has additional features like stemming
lists of words.

L<Lingua::Stem::Any> provides a unified interface to any stemmer on CPAN,
including this one, as well as additional features like normalization,
casefolding, and in-place stemming.
